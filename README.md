# DocReporter
ReporterDoc designed to parse lengthy, complex PDF documents (200+ pages) and automatically generate concise, structured summaries (~5â€“8 pages). It preserves layout and semantics using advanced parsing tools like Kreuzberg and LayoutParser, then transforms the extracted content into human-readable reports enhanced with charts and diagrams.
